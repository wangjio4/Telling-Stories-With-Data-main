**Abstract**
As population control and reproductive health initiatives increasingly target individual women's needs, understanding how women make and execute reproductive choices is critical. With the help of the NRO research, women's daily lives are better understood, and impediments to reaching reproductive and health objectives are identified. The research includes focus groups and a gender survey. The survey results were intended to provide estimates for urban and rural regions within each district. Generally, most respondents live with their spouse and few live with other adult relatives (residence and marriage). Approximately a quarter of respondentsâ€™ report being in polygynous relationships.
**1.0 Introduction**
As population control and reproductive health services increasingly emphasize tactics tailored to the unique requirements of specific women, it is critical to understand the contexts in which women make and execute reproductive choices. Understanding the reality of women's daily lives and identifying potential barriers to reaching reproductive and health objectives are vital if programs are to be responsive to women's needs for certain sorts of information or services. Simultaneously, men's roles and demands are acknowledged as critical for comprehending the complexities of reproductive choice making. This data is vital for tracking and evaluating programs that aim to offer couples with user-friendly women's health and reproductive health services.
**2.0 Data**
Numerous similar features appear when data on optimum fertility and birth spacing are analyzed. In both research locations, ideal fertility standards are rather high, ranging between five and six children per woman. Women prefer to have fewer children and space their pregnancies farther apart, despite the fact that these preferences are minor and confined mostly to metropolitan regions. Men's and women's wants are comparable in rural places. But even without direct communication, most people know what their partners want. They propose that suggestive statements or overheard talks are the most essential type of indirect verbal communication and bargaining between spouses about childbearing concerns. Nonetheless, over half of those polled said they had discussed having another child with their spouse. 

**3.0 Results and Discussion**
Each country has its own distinct fertility trends. Kenya and Tanzania's latest TFR studies suggest that the nations' declining fertility has reversed significantly, with TFR higher than in each country's previous research. TFR decreased in both Uganda and Zimbabwe, albeit at different rates of fertility. A slowdown in Zimbabwe's population decline has occurred over the last 15 years; in Uganda, fertility has stayed steady throughout a 19-year survey period. 
Even in three of Uganda's districts, the 2007 TFR varied from 6.8 to 7.6 children per woman. Fertility continued to drop in 60% of areas, although somewhat in certain cases, between surveys. In 10 of the 27 areas studied, a pause in fertility decrease was observed, where fertility rates in perhaps the most recent survey were equal to or greater than the fertility levels in the third poll and the territory had previously shown a meaningful drop in fertility. 
**4.0 Conclusion**
There is a strong correlation between human development strategies (education and health) and fertility drop in this area. Decreases in the percentage of women with secondary or higher education or formal employment were associated with strong reversals in fertility drop in areas with big reversals in fertility decline. With fertility stagnating in Kenya and Tanzania, as well as Uganda's slight reduction from pre-transition levels, the outlook for these nations' population growth over the next two decades is quite positive. Numerous SSA nations will not be able to fulfill their MDG objectives due to the significant links between high population expansion and low economic growth and development.
